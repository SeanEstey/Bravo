    Hi, this is a friendly reminder that your Vecova 

    {% if account['udf']['status'] == "Dropoff" %}
				dropoff 
    {% else %}
        pickup 
    {% endif %}

    is {{ account['udf']['pickup_dt'] }}. 

    {% if account['udf']['status'] == "Dropoff" %}
        If you have any empties you can leave them out by 8am.
    {% elif account['udf']['status'] == "Active" or account['udf']['status'] == "One-time" %}
        Please have your empties out by 8am. Glass can be separated into cases.
    {% elif account['udf']['status'] == "Cancelling" %}
        A driver will be by to collect your bag buddy frame. Thanks for your past support.
    {% endif %}

		If you do not need a pickup, reply with 'NO PICKUP'.
